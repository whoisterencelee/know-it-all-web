Choose Our Adventure Series: Antetus Argentum, #2<br /><br />Smooth jazz plays over the bar's speakers as you clear tables. Some patrons have left behind payment slips, single-use reciept printouts featuring the familiar machine-readable patterns which uniquely identify the bar's payment accounts. You scan each pattern, and the register beeps as it closes the orders from across the room, then you throw the payment strips into the trash, along with half-sodden coasters, peanut wrappers, and the occasional rare paper napkin.<br /><br />As you are tossing one fistfull of payment slips into the trash bin, something on the back of one of them catches your eye. A web handle that you thought you had kept separate from your daily life. One you have barely used even online. You fish the paper with the strangely familiar name on it out of the bin, and flatten it out to see the rest. Not much. Just your handle and twelve seemingly random words.<br /><br />Option 1: pocket the slip with the twelve words. It's addressed to you.<br /><br />Option 2: trash the slip with the twelve words. That name is secret for a reason.<br /><br />Option 3: Make a suggestion.

Choose Our Adventure Series: Antetus Argentum, part 1<br /><br />It's been a long night at work, in fact, and the day is getting ready to start again when your last patrons leave the bar, and the room, once cluttered with the drone of a dozen discconnected conversations is filled only by the late-night news stream, and the hum of an ancient jukebox in the corner. The newscaster's voice cuts out as you turn the monitor off with the remote hidden beneath the bar counter.<br /><br />You pick a couple of coins out from a dish sitting next to the register and walk over to the ancient music device, drop the two equally ancient metallic circles into a coin slot on the front, and select a couple of songs. Something to listen to, while you grab a cleaning rag and a spray bottle and begin making your final rounds on the bar, and clean the tables up for the night. Bottles are thrown in a large, blue recycling bin in the corner, glasses are placed in the sink and filled with water, dilluting the suds and drips of alcohol resting in the bottom, and every table is given a once-over with the rag, leaving it cleaned and ready for the start of tomorrow's business.<br /><br />What music did you choose?<br /><br />Option 1: Smooth jazz. Something relaxing but still upbeat, to finish off the day<br /><br />Option 2: Industrial. Nobody here for the loud music to bother.<br /><br />Option 3: Make a suggestion.
