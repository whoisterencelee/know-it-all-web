It's been a long night at work, in fact, and the day is getting ready to start again when your last patrons leave the bar, and the room, once cluttered with the drone of a dozen discconnected conversations is filled only by the late-night news stream, and the hum of an ancient jukebox in the corner. The newscaster's voice cuts out as you turn the monitor off with the remote hidden beneath the bar counter.<br /><br />You pick a couple of coins out from a dish sitting next to the register and walk over to the ancient music device, drop the two equally ancient metallic circles into a coin slot on the front, and select a couple of songs. Something to listen to, while you grab a cleaning rag and a spray bottle and begin making your final rounds on the bar, and clean the tables up for the night. Bottles are thrown in a large, blue recycling bin in the corner, glasses are placed in the sink and filled with water, dilluting the suds and drips of alcohol resting in the bottom, and every table is given a once-over with the rag, leaving it cleaned and ready for the start of tomorrow's business.

Smooth jazz plays over the bar's speakers as you clear tables. Some patrons have left behind payment slips, single-use reciept printouts featuring the familiar machine-readable patterns which uniquely identify the bar's payment accounts. You scan each pattern, and the register beeps as it closes the orders from across the room, then you throw the payment strips into the trash, along with half-sodden coasters, peanut wrappers, and the occasional rare paper napkin.<br /><br />As you are tossing one fistfull of payment slips into the trash bin, something on the back of one of them catches your eye. A web handle that you thought you had kept separate from your daily life. One you have barely used even online. You fish the paper with the strangely familiar name on it out of the bin, and flatten it out to see the rest. Not much. Just your handle and twelve seemingly random words.

You franticly think over your recent interactions both on the net and in the physical world, but you can't think of anything that would lead someone here. You crumple the paper and shove it into a pocket in your uniform. A haze of panicked distraction clouds your thoughts as you rush through stacking the stools and chairs on top of the bar tables. You sweep the floors, but forget to mop before turning the lights out, locking the door, and leaving.<br /><br />The sun is just peeking over the horizon. The Argentum bar, where you work, is located far from the city center. The buildings are older here, the roads still brick and cobblestone, but the dawn casts an intense backlight over the skyscrapers to the east, washing out the lights of people who are just going to bed , people who are just waking up, people who, like you, have worked through the night.

You rush quickly back to your apartment, the mystery slip of paper forgotten. You've never had Netflix, of course. Why pay to watch things when they don't even have what you want to watch half the time? Besides which, Stranger Things hasn't been available on Netflix for decades since being accquired by Disney. Your torrent should have finished while you were at work, though.<br /><br />Your door has an older-style mechanical lock on it. They still work when the power goes out, and don't have a network connection to hack, a problem that has come up for several of your neighbors recently. Your apartment is cozy and well-kept. You live alone, and so don't bother with shyness as you shed your bartender's vest, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt, tossing them into a pile. You also undo your long, silvery hair from the neat ponytail and let it hang loose across your shoulders. You throw on a comfy nightgown and grab a snack, and start the early morning TV binge that will kick off your mid-week weekend.<br /><br />What will you be eating during your marathon?

You're working on a particularly difficult cypher. Someone has stolen all of the chocolate chip cookies from the Chips Ahoy factory, but the thief got sloppy and left one of his shoes behind. It's the type with the light-up bits that were popular in the 1990s, seems they've made a bit of a resurgence. If you can just gain access to the flashing module, you can figure out where the thief lives, and just maybe you can get there before he bakes all of the chocolate chips. You're so close to the solution, when a noise outside distracts you. The world spins as you fall over.<br /><br />You wake up with a start, falling off of the loveseat. The familiar orange traffic cone icon glares at you from the display hanging on your apartment wall. Half a bowl of popcorn is now strewn across the floor. You can't seem to remember anything from your Stranger Things marathon. You must have dozed off early, and based on the waning light outside your window, you probably slept through the day.<br /><br />Well, it was a late night. More importantly, there's a noise outside of your apartment. It sounds like someone's moving into the module next door to yours.

A knock at your front door clears any remnants of sleep. You check that you're at least presentable, and check the peep hole. The man on the other side has a neat brown haircut, brown eyes, is wearing a blue button-down shirt, and gray slacks. He's holding something with both hands, which looks like a dish of some sort. Next to him is a woman, bearing similarly nondescript features, and wearing a white button-down blouse. Their faces bear blank expressions.<br /><br />The man raps on the door again, and you open it. Their faces are both now bearing too-wide smiles. "Hello, Neighbor! We're the Smith family. My name is John, and this is my lovely wife, Jane. Just here to bring you a housewarming present, miss..."<br /><br />"Somna," you offer. His voice has the cadence of some sort of game show announcer. You can see, now, that the dish is a tray of brownies. "Isn't it a bit late in the day for greetings?"<br /><br />"We knocked on your door earlier," Jane's voice has the same overinflated cadence as her husband's. "You must have been asleep. Do you work nights?"<br /><br />John is holding the tray of brownies out to you.

"You take the plate of brownies. "Uh... yeah,"<br /><br />"Well, see you around," Jane says in her too-friendly way. The couple wave at you, and then walk back next door. You close and lock the door, and through the window you see that their animated facade and practically march past your window.<br /><br />Well that was weird. You set the brownies down on your kitchen counter and start gathering up the clothing that you have left strewn around the apartment. The weekend will end soon, and it would be nice to have a uniform to wear for work when it does. The vest pocket of your bartending uniform crumples asyou pick it up, and you remember the slip from last night.<br /><br />Who could that be from? What could they want?<br /><br />It would be so easy to just "accidentally" wash it with the rest of your laundry. That would destroy the note, but what of the person who wrote it?

The note is the recovery phrase for a cryptocurrency wallet. That much is obvious. Was obvious the moment you saw it. Searching for the words won't bring you any closer to figuring out who left it. Those lists are supposed to be secret, anyway. You grab one of the brownies and take a bite while you consider your next move.<br /><br />These are really good, actually. A touch bitter, and slightly on the dry side. They would probably be great with milk. You put the half-eaten brownie back and load your clothes into the laundry, then return to the kitchen and pour a glass of milk and finish the brownie.<br /><br />Yeah, that was a good plan.<br /><br />You stare at the paper while the washing machine runs.

You hand-copy the 12 words from the slip onto a separate sheet of paper, and like the original note, simply label it "@sleepycat." You shove the sheet of paper back into your vest pocket before loading it into the wash, and the fresh copy is placed safely with the rest of your wallet backup keys. The unreadable, water-logged smear that emerges from your vest pocket is deposited in the trash, looking no different from any other washed receipt.<br /><br />Chores done, the rest of your weekend goes smoothly. Your neighbors don't answer the door when you go to return the plate that the incredibly good brownies were on, and you don't want to leave it outside, so you bring it back in and leave it on your counter. You'll try again later. Or maybe they'll come back for it. <br /><br />You spend some time in your usual online haunts, but don't bring up the note or ask any questions. Someone is running a cryptography puzzle, and while you don't usually have the attention span to participate, you do end up giving ideas to some of the people who are while discussing it, in the middle of your usual binge of cat videos and looking up new drink recipes.<br /><br />The beginning of your work week arrives without fanfare, but in addition to your regular patrons, two men do happen to show up. They stand out in their nice black-tie suits and dark sunglasses. One claims a table near the back, while the other asks for two glasses and a bottle of whiskey, scans his payment code and closes the bill, and then takes the glasses and bottle to join his friend. You're not sure exactly when they left the bar. They certainly stayed longer than most patrons do, but they also weren't around by the time you gave last call.<br /><br />Nothing else out of the ordinary happens tonight.

Smiths don't answer their door again. You get three more episodes into Stranger Things before forcing yourself to go to bed, knowing that if you don't, you won't be able to function at work tomorrow. You dream that you have to pee and can't find a bathroom, before waking up and running to your toilet. Perhaps finishing the entire 2-liter in one night wasn't the best course of action.<br /><br />You're able to read up a little more on the cryptography puzzle. Two people managed to find a solution at more or less the same time, and they ended up splitting the prize between them, but less than an hour after they released the solution, it turned out there was another stage to the puzzle, and they'd just revealed what it was to the entire internet, so now it's anyone's game again, and the rumors are that the next prize is more than ten times what the last one was.<br /><br />Work is uneventful. The MIBs don't show up tonight, or at least you don't notice them. The jukebox is getting a workout, and you have to empty it twice to get coins to put back into the dish. You're thinking about getting back to Stranger Things tonight, when one of the bar patrons walks up and asks for a drink, and you freeze.<br /><br />"I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"<br /><br />The man has beady eyes, a plain blonde crew-cut, and is oddly thin. "I said I'd like a Sleepycat."

You tell the man that you're not familiar with the drink he's requesting. You try to wear a cheerful mask, but you're not convinced that the entire bar can't hear your pulse pounding in your ears.<br /><br />He blinks twice, and says nothing for several seconds, before stammering out the name of a drink you actually do know how to make. It's not the smoothest mix. Your hands are still shaking from the adrenaline spike that just flooded your system, but it gets the job done. As he takes the drink back to his table.<br /><br />That was weird. What's with all the attention your online presence seems to be attracting lately? Might be time to retire it and start a new one. Come to think of it, one of your weekend regulars is also missing tonight. Wonder what happened to him.<br /><br />The bar closes, and the patrons start to filter out. You're about to lock the door when a pair of guys with hoods shove the door back, and muscle their way inside.
