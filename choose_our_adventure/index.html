It's been a long night at work, in fact, and the day is getting ready to start again when your last patrons leave the bar, and the room, once cluttered with the drone of a dozen discconnected conversations is filled only by the late-night news stream, and the hum of an ancient jukebox in the corner. The newscaster's voice cuts out as you turn the monitor off with the remote hidden beneath the bar counter.<br /><br />You pick a couple of coins out from a dish sitting next to the register and walk over to the ancient music device, drop the two equally ancient metallic circles into a coin slot on the front, and select a couple of songs. Something to listen to, while you grab a cleaning rag and a spray bottle and begin making your final rounds on the bar, and clean the tables up for the night. Bottles are thrown in a large, blue recycling bin in the corner, glasses are placed in the sink and filled with water, dilluting the suds and drips of alcohol resting in the bottom, and every table is given a once-over with the rag, leaving it cleaned and ready for the start of tomorrow's business.

Smooth jazz plays over the bar's speakers as you clear tables. Some patrons have left behind payment slips, single-use reciept printouts featuring the familiar machine-readable patterns which uniquely identify the bar's payment accounts. You scan each pattern, and the register beeps as it closes the orders from across the room, then you throw the payment strips into the trash, along with half-sodden coasters, peanut wrappers, and the occasional rare paper napkin.<br /><br />As you are tossing one fistfull of payment slips into the trash bin, something on the back of one of them catches your eye. A web handle that you thought you had kept separate from your daily life. One you have barely used even online. You fish the paper with the strangely familiar name on it out of the bin, and flatten it out to see the rest. Not much. Just your handle and twelve seemingly random words.

You franticly think over your recent interactions both on the net and in the physical world, but you can't think of anything that would lead someone here. You crumple the paper and shove it into a pocket in your uniform. A haze of panicked distraction clouds your thoughts as you rush through stacking the stools and chairs on top of the bar tables. You sweep the floors, but forget to mop before turning the lights out, locking the door, and leaving.<br /><br />The sun is just peeking over the horizon. The Argentum bar, where you work, is located far from the city center. The buildings are older here, the roads still brick and cobblestone, but the dawn casts an intense backlight over the skyscrapers to the east, washing out the lights of people who are just going to bed , people who are just waking up, people who, like you, have worked through the night.

You rush quickly back to your apartment, the mystery slip of paper forgotten. You've never had Netflix, of course. Why pay to watch things when they don't even have what you want to watch half the time? Besides which, Stranger Things hasn't been available on Netflix for decades since being accquired by Disney. Your torrent should have finished while you were at work, though.<br /><br />Your door has an older-style mechanical lock on it. They still work when the power goes out, and don't have a network connection to hack, a problem that has come up for several of your neighbors recently. Your apartment is cozy and well-kept. You live alone, and so don't bother with shyness as you shed your bartender's vest, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt, tossing them into a pile. You also undo your long, silvery hair from the neat ponytail and let it hang loose across your shoulders. You throw on a comfy nightgown and grab a snack, and start the early morning TV binge that will kick off your mid-week weekend.<br /><br />What will you be eating during your marathon?

You're working on a particularly difficult cypher. Someone has stolen all of the chocolate chip cookies from the Chips Ahoy factory, but the thief got sloppy and left one of his shoes behind. It's the type with the light-up bits that were popular in the 1990s, seems they've made a bit of a resurgence. If you can just gain access to the flashing module, you can figure out where the thief lives, and just maybe you can get there before he bakes all of the chocolate chips. You're so close to the solution, when a noise outside distracts you. The world spins as you fall over.<br /><br />You wake up with a start, falling off of the loveseat. The familiar orange traffic cone icon glares at you from the display hanging on your apartment wall. Half a bowl of popcorn is now strewn across the floor. You can't seem to remember anything from your Stranger Things marathon. You must have dozed off early, and based on the waning light outside your window, you probably slept through the day.<br /><br />Well, it was a late night. More importantly, there's a noise outside of your apartment. It sounds like someone's moving into the module next door to yours.

<p>
A knock at your front door clears any remnants of sleep. You check that you're at least presentable, and check the peep hole. The man on the other side has a neat brown haircut, brown eyes, is wearing a blue button-down shirt, and gray slacks. He's holding something with both hands, which looks like a dish of some sort. Next to him is a woman, bearing similarly nondescript features, and wearing a white button-down blouse. Their faces bear blank expressions.<br /><br />The man raps on the door again, and you open it. Their faces are both now bearing too-wide smiles. "Hello, Neighbor! We're the Smith family. My name is John, and this is my lovely wife, Jane. Just here to bring you a housewarming present, miss..."<br /><br />"Somna," you offer. His voice has the cadence of some sort of game show announcer. You can see, now, that the dish is a tray of brownies. "Isn't it a bit late in the day for greetings?"<br /><br />"We knocked on your door earlier," Jane's voice has the same overinflated cadence as her husband's. "You must have been asleep. Do you work nights?"<br /><br />John is holding the tray of brownies out to you.
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@220">@220</a>
<p>
"You take the plate of brownies. "Uh... yeah,"<br /><br />"Well, see you around," Jane says in her too-friendly way. The couple wave at you, and then walk back next door. You close and lock the door, and through the window you see that their animated facade and practically march past your window.<br /><br />Well that was weird. You set the brownies down on your kitchen counter and start gathering up the clothing that you have left strewn around the apartment. The weekend will end soon, and it would be nice to have a uniform to wear for work when it does. The vest pocket of your bartending uniform crumples asyou pick it up, and you remember the slip from last night.<br /><br />Who could that be from? What could they want?<br /><br />It would be so easy to just "accidentally" wash it with the rest of your laundry. That would destroy the note, but what of the person who wrote it?
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@228">@228</a>
<p>
The note is the recovery phrase for a cryptocurrency wallet. That much is obvious. Was obvious the moment you saw it. Searching for the words won't bring you any closer to figuring out who left it. Those lists are supposed to be secret, anyway. You grab one of the brownies and take a bite while you consider your next move.<br /><br />These are really good, actually. A touch bitter, and slightly on the dry side. They would probably be great with milk. You put the half-eaten brownie back and load your clothes into the laundry, then return to the kitchen and pour a glass of milk and finish the brownie.<br /><br />Yeah, that was a good plan.<br /><br />You stare at the paper while the washing machine runs.
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@237">@237</a>
<p>
You hand-copy the 12 words from the slip onto a separate sheet of paper, and like the original note, simply label it "@sleepycat." You shove the sheet of paper back into your vest pocket before loading it into the wash, and the fresh copy is placed safely with the rest of your wallet backup keys. The unreadable, water-logged smear that emerges from your vest pocket is deposited in the trash, looking no different from any other washed receipt.<br /><br />Chores done, the rest of your weekend goes smoothly. Your neighbors don't answer the door when you go to return the plate that the incredibly good brownies were on, and you don't want to leave it outside, so you bring it back in and leave it on your counter. You'll try again later. Or maybe they'll come back for it. <br /><br />You spend some time in your usual online haunts, but don't bring up the note or ask any questions. Someone is running a cryptography puzzle, and while you don't usually have the attention span to participate, you do end up giving ideas to some of the people who are while discussing it, in the middle of your usual binge of cat videos and looking up new drink recipes.<br /><br />The beginning of your work week arrives without fanfare, but in addition to your regular patrons, two men do happen to show up. They stand out in their nice black-tie suits and dark sunglasses. One claims a table near the back, while the other asks for two glasses and a bottle of whiskey, scans his payment code and closes the bill, and then takes the glasses and bottle to join his friend. You're not sure exactly when they left the bar. They certainly stayed longer than most patrons do, but they also weren't around by the time you gave last call.<br /><br />Nothing else out of the ordinary happens tonight.

Smiths don't answer their door again. You get three more episodes into Stranger Things before forcing yourself to go to bed, knowing that if you don't, you won't be able to function at work tomorrow. You dream that you have to pee and can't find a bathroom, before waking up and running to your toilet. Perhaps finishing the entire 2-liter in one night wasn't the best course of action.<br /><br />You're able to read up a little more on the cryptography puzzle. Two people managed to find a solution at more or less the same time, and they ended up splitting the prize between them, but less than an hour after they released the solution, it turned out there was another stage to the puzzle, and they'd just revealed what it was to the entire internet, so now it's anyone's game again, and the rumors are that the next prize is more than ten times what the last one was.<br /><br />Work is uneventful. The MIBs don't show up tonight, or at least you don't notice them. The jukebox is getting a workout, and you have to empty it twice to get coins to put back into the dish. You're thinking about getting back to Stranger Things tonight, when one of the bar patrons walks up and asks for a drink, and you freeze.<br /><br />"I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"<br /><br />The man has beady eyes, a plain blonde crew-cut, and is oddly thin. "I said I'd like a Sleepycat."
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@248">@248</a>
<p>
You tell the man that you're not familiar with the drink he's requesting. You try to wear a cheerful mask, but you're not convinced that the entire bar can't hear your pulse pounding in your ears.<br /><br />He blinks twice, and says nothing for several seconds, before stammering out the name of a drink you actually do know how to make. It's not the smoothest mix. Your hands are still shaking from the adrenaline spike that just flooded your system, but it gets the job done. As he takes the drink back to his table.<br /><br />That was weird. What's with all the attention your online presence seems to be attracting lately? Might be time to retire it and start a new one. Come to think of it, one of your weekend regulars is also missing tonight. Wonder what happened to him.<br /><br />The bar closes, and the patrons start to filter out. You're about to lock the door when a pair of guys with hoods shove the door back, and muscle their way inside.

Last call was half an hour ago, boys, but I can give you a bottle for the road." Technically the register's closed, but that's not hard to fix. Especially when the alternative is seeing how creative a pair of ruffians who don't seem willing to take "no" for an answer are capable of being. You edge back behind the countertop.<br /><br />"We're looking for the Sleepycat." A voice to your side catches you entirely off-guard. The blonde guy from earlier managed to stick around, apparently. How did you miss him? You manage to get the bar between you and all three, now, intruders, and tap the silent alarm<br /><br />"I told you, I don't know how to make that one," you continue bluffing. "And again, last call was half an hour ago. I can't legally serve you anything."<br /><br />Suddenly, two more men burst through the front door. Awfully fast response time for law enforcement. You think they look like the sharply-dressed gentlemen who were here last night, but they all kind of look the same in that Men In Black getup. That answers that question.

You duck behind the bar and sneak into the back. This is one of those problems you're happy to let sort itself out, and you did skip your lunch break. There are chicken tenders waiting for you in the freezer.<br /><br />Of course, that does mean you're going to have to clean up the mess when they're done. And the bar will probably be closed tomorrow. Saturday. The biggest night of the week.<br /><br />Yeah, boss is going to be thrilled about that. And then there's all this sudden interest in Sleepycat. Maybe it's time to start up a new alias. You'll probably want to see what's in that wallet that was addressed to you first, though. Probably through a secure VPN. Or five.<br /><br />These are all hard questions, though. You can deal with them later. For now, easy questions. Like what dressing to have with your chicken tenders.

You grab the jar of home-made dressing from the back of the walk-in refrigerator, sitting next to 2 gallons of cow's milk and a gallon of goat's milk for certain eccentric patrons. Someone was trying to convince you last week that dairy products were illegal. You had to cut him off for the night when he insisted the dairy shop you frequent, just down the street, was actually a front for organ harvesters.<br /><br />Those brownies your weird new neighbors brought over did go really well with the milk you had in your fridge.<br /><br />The dressing is a recipe you had suggested to you by an acquaintance on some forum. You'd been letting it age for a few days, and the smoky flavor that fills your mouth is exquisite. You savor every bite and try not to think too hard about the crashing and yelling going on in the front room.<br /><br />Where are the police, anyway? You tripped the silent alarm almost half an hour ago now.
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@268">@268</a>
<p>
The commotion is loud, and the chicken tenders are tasty, and trying to get involved in whatever's happening in the front room would probably only get you injured, anyway. You'll let them sort themselves out for a few more minutes, and hope the damage isn't too bad once the police do arrive.<br /><br />And now someone is pounding on the back door. Fortunately that can only be opened from the inside. Whoever it is starts shouting, though.<br /><br />"Hey, whoever's in there, I'm here to help you."<br /><br />The sounds out front have stopped sounding like shouting and people getting hit and more like furnature being upended and smashed.<br /><br />"Open up, hurry, they won't take much longer."<br /><br />For some reason, there's no peephole in the door.
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@273">@273</a>
<p>
You peek around the doorframe to see what's going on in the front room. One of the hooded guys who rushed you at the front door is on the floor, unconscious. The other one is gone or out of view. One of the MIBs is keeping watch at the front door, while sounds that you can now identify as furnature being upended emerge from outside your field of view. Several of the chairs you can see are broken, and one table is on its side.<br /><br />The boss is going to be furious. You hope the insurance will cover this, but the bar's going to be closed for a few days minimum. You might need to look for a second job in the meantime.<br /><br />Someone is still pounding on the back door, and the police are still not here! Should you call them directly?
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@282">@282</a>
<p>
You back deeper into the kitchen and dial the line for local law enforcement on your phone. After providing some basic information to the automated systems, you're quickly transferred to a human operator.<br /><br />"Miss... Somna? How can I help you?"<br /><br />"Yes, I'm at the Argentum bar. I was supposed to close almost an hour ago, but two men shoved the door open and two more came in after them."<br /><br />"Ah, yes. We have here that officers are already on location and dealing with the situation."<br /><br />"Well there's nobody here except two of the men, and they're tearing the bar apart."<br /><br />"I'm sorry, but that's all I can tell you. Have a nice evening." The line goes dead.<br /><br />Even if you could go home, which, with both of your exits cut off is a dubious option, that would just be leaving the two men in the front room free to do whatever they want until someone shows up in the morning, to say nothing of leaving the doors unlocked. You should probably call your boss at bare minimum. Actually you should probably have done that already.
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@289">@289</a>
<p>
You determine that the direct approach is probably best here. Taking a deep breath and hoping they haven't destroyed the whiskey, you step back into the front room.<br /><br />The ancient, coin-operated jukebox has been torn open. Seeing it in that state is like a gut punch, given the maintenance you've performed on the thing yourself. It cost your boss a small fortune to buy, and was so old that you couldn't even find someone to repair it, and had to track down manuals to get it working yourself. It's been a fixture in the bar for a number of years now, but it looks like that's all over.<br /><br />The register is open, and the second of the well-dressed men is rummaging through the drawer when he notices you.<br /><br />"There you are. We own this bar now. We were coming by to let you know when we met these two." He motions towards the thugs from earlier who broke in as you were trying to lock the door. "We need to get a few things from you, and then you can go home. Do you mind waiting until we get everything taken care of?"<br /><br />You weren't sure what you were expecting, but this wasn't it. You aren't even sure how to begin to respond to everything you've just been told.
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@294">@294</a>
<p>
"Wait, you own the bar? Since when?"<br /><br />"We finalized the purchase just a few hours ago. It seems your boss did not inform you." He pulls out his phone and shows you the public crypto record indicating the bar certificate of ownership transfer and that he is acting in ownership authority, or at least the owner of that phone is, and you pull the record up on your own device to verify. Cryptographically-signed public records have been in widespread use since the middle of the 21st century, and the one he shows you appears to be legitimate.<br /><br />You note the sum paid in exchange for ownership of the bar, as well. That certainly explains why the purchase was able to go through so quickly. More money than you ever imagined you would see change hands at once.<br /><br />"We need your help taking care of a few details, and then you will be free to go," he continues. "We are looking for someone who has been here often. Mister Michael Blake. Caucasian male, average height, overweight, light brown hair, unassuming." Good conversationalist, you think to yourself. He was conspicuously absent tonight, and you inform the man you haven't seen him. "That is unfortunate. We hoped to find information here as to his werebouts. Has any customer left a note, by chance?  Anything which may help us find him.
</p>

You tell the man about the note you found on the back of a receipt on Monday. He seems surprised that you aren't trying to hide it, and asks you how many of the words you can remember from the list. Well you wrote it down so you wouldn't have to remember, so you're only able to dig up two, and you're not entirely sure about one of them. He asks if you still have the note somewhere, and you confess that you washed it to destroy the message.<br /><br />This line of questioning seems oddly entirely unrelated to the operation of a drinking establishment, but you don't say anything about that, and politely continue to answer the man's questions as his line of inquiry moves away from the note you found Monday and to conversations you've had with Mike, on the topic of cryptographic algorithms and interesting electronics puzzles. He actually seems fairly fixated on the conversations you've had, to the exclusion of any sort of applicable knowledge, but you continue to answer all of his questions honestly.<br /><br />After more than an hour of questioning, the man seems to be satisfied. He gives you a business card contact information on it and tells you that if you have any more information to provide, you can reach him there. You're then quickly shuffled out of the door.

<p>
Well. You guess you don't have work in the morning. You don't think your finances are in bad shape, but you pull out your phone to check your wallet balance idly as you walk home for the night.<br /><br />There's a rather large deposit with a note attached. At least your boss takes care of you. Took care of you. There's also a text message that arrived partway through your interview with the bar's new owner which basically confirms everything you were told. She was contacted by them midway through your shift and offered the absurd amount of money that you saw on the contract transfer. Too much to say "no" to. She's been looking at private islands for the past hour.<br /><br />Well, maybe the island will have a bar on it. For now, while your own bonus should be enough to keep you through your upcoming unemployment period, it won't last forever. Though maybe you could afford a jukebox to replace the one left behind at the bar. And you can step up the freelance work in some of your online communities.<br /><br />At home, you repeat your now-normal routine of trying to give the Smiths their plate back, waiting several minutes, and getting no response.
</p>

<p>
You leave the plate outside of the Smiths' door. It's their plate. If they don't want it, someone else can have it. It's not your responsibility. You have more important things to worry about now. Namely, what you're going to use to replace the income that you just lost.<br /><br />Mike is missing. Which, of course, explains why he wasn't at the bar today. You reminisce about some of the conversations you've had with him. Radiation hardening of electronics, movement compensation, geopositioning in three dimensions. The last few weeks he seems to have been pretty interested in the idea of self-encrypting code. He was apparently experimenting with techniques to keep data safe even from users with physical system access. And the only clue seems to be that note that was left behind.<br /><br />Meanwhile, you're going to need a new source of income. Relocating shouldn't be a problem given the huge bonus you've just received, if that becomes an issue, though it would be time-consuming to have to pack all of your stuff. On the other hand, you could probably do some freelance work, get paid for all of the cryptographic advice you give people online.<br /><br />Maybe you should see what stage that contest is on, if you can jump in.

Time to apply for what you know, and you definitely know bartending. You do a quick search for bartending positions nearby. When that doesn't bring up more than a handful of opportunities, you expand the search to bars, and then to general clubs and restaurants in your area, make a list, and start going down the particulars.<br /><br />But you've got a couple of months' worth of pay in your pocket now, so once you've got those put together, you jump back into Stranger Things for another episode. Or 5. Most of these places won't be open until morning, anyway.<br /><br />You wake up in the early afternoon. Restaurants should be in full swing, bars and clubs won't be open yet but might be preparing to start operations. You get prepared and dressed, have an afternoon breakfast of milk and cereal, and dress... to impress. Sure it's just your old bartending uniform from the Argentum, with a blazer instead of a vest, but it looks professional and should be sufficient for an interview. You pick up your list. There's a family restaurant, a high-class restaurant, and a night club that opens in a few hours.
</p>
<a class="post" href="byteball:Ai9tK3w0yQNvbR8kpQU5uOLRloQQXdFXJFFNZkdQN8fr@byteball.org/bb#@319">@319</a>
<p>
You decide that the family restauarants will be an "if nothing else" option. Screaming kids are a professional alcohol server's worst nightmare. At least the "I need to speak to the manager" ladies are usually drunk enough by the time they get to that point you can point them out the door.<br /><br />Not that you would ever allow any of your customers to get that drunk. But hey, mistakes happen. Especially to customers who like to cause trouble.<br /><br />You visit the high-class restaurant. They give you an application form to fill out, which you do, and tell you they'll call you in a couple of days. You wander around for another hour and then make your way to the club. Delune Night Club and Bar. The owner there is a bit more laid-back. He says he's not looking for a bartender at the moment, but he gives you an interview anyway, then introduces you to the bouncers on duty for the night and tells you to come back tonight when the club opens. "And wear something nice."<br /><br />Your bartending uniform from Argentum is the nicest clothing you currently own, but you don't know how well it would look at DeLune. There's a clothing shop in town and a couple of hours before the club opens.

You don't see a need to buy a new outfit, since you assume the invitation was work-based. When you reach home, you're greeted by another plate of brownies sitting outside of your front door.<br /><br />Well that's friendly of them.<br /><br />You spend the couple of hours between now and when the club opens cleaning and prepping your uniform, making yourself look as professional as possible. You catch a rideshare from a street corner near your apartment most of the way to the club to save yourself from having to walk the whole way.<br /><br />The bouncer at the door is friendly. He greets you by name and lets you cut the line to get in. Inside, the music is, as usual, deafening.

You've never been much for dancing, and the bartending uniform isn't ideal dancewear, but it's fine to cut loose once in a while, in an area where everyone is too drunk to tell that you're doing it wrong. The music throbs in the background giving you a solid beat to move to, and for a while, you just exist in the moment. It feels good, and it's a load off of your shoulders to not think about anything for a few minutes. Eventually you decide to take a break, and make your way over to the bar.<br /><br />When you order your drink, the bartender you're talking to does a double-take. Cobalt Velvet was one of the more popular drinks that you mixed back at the Argentum, and has become a favorite of yours. The bartender informs you that he has only served it once before, to an older gentleman a number of years ago. He doesn't remember much beyond that.<br /><br />Cobalt Velvet reminds you of another drink that you developed yourself. You were pretty sure it was unique to Argentum, but patrons regularly teach bartenders new drinks that they've had elsewhere. If Mike has been here, he almost certainly would have taught the bartender how to make it.<br /><br />Through the writhing bodies on the dance floor, you catch a glimpse of a man in a black suit, with slicked back hair and dark sunglasses. It brings you back to the new owners of what used to be the Argentum bar, and another thought crosses your mind.

"Could I get a Sleepycat?" you ask the bartender.<br /><br />He blinks. "I'm... sorry, I'm not familiar with that one." Yeah, that checks out. "You know, you're the second person to ask that."<br /><br />"Oh?"<br /><br />"Yeah, there was this guy last week, came in wearing a hoodie. Had a fake eye that I think he was trying to hide with sunglasses."<br /><br />"Hey, I thought I told you to dress nice, not dress like a bartender." The DeLune's owner shows up. "Nah, it's cool. Having nice looking girls like you around is good for business. Might want to invest in some dance lessons, though. You still looking for a job? Hey Stevo, what do you think?"<br /><br />The bartender shrugs. "She can't dance, she asked for two drinks, and I only know how to make one of 'em," he says, "and that doesn't really tell me anything about her bartending ability, anyway."<br /><br />"Good point," the owner says, then turns back to you. "Well you're already dressed for it. Let's see what you've got.

You put a lot of work into developing the Silver Star. It has a mild, but refined flavor, low fizz, and most notably, the drink itself takes on a silvery sheen, with a fluorescent gradient towards the top of the slender glass. You mix three with efficient but smooth motions, and slide two of them to the bartender and the club owner.<br /><br />The owner, for his part, stares blankly at you for a few seconds before realizing there's a drink in front of him, while the bartender has already begun sampling his. Being your own creation, the Silver Star is also your personal favorite drink, and you raise the third glass to your lips, examining your own work. Slightly bitter, slightly too sweet, smoother than usual. You weigh what would need to be adjusted given the ingredient differences between here and Argentum.<br /><br />The bartender's mouth opens to give his opinion on the drink when the owner, who still hasn't touched his, stammers out "so, ah, w- when can you start?"<br /><br />"At least try the drink," you reply.<br /><br />"It's good," the bartender says. "What do you call this one?

"This, gentlemen," you say somewhat more grandiosely than usual, "is the Sleepycat."<br /><br />Argentum bar is closed, and you did invent it, you may as well name the drink after yourself. Sort of. Secretly?<br /><br />At the name "Sleepycat," the club's owner chokes and sprays alcohol across you and the bar. You glare at him. "That's a new one."<br /><br />"Oh, no. It's um, good. Yes, it's really good. So good I um..." he shotguns the rest to shut himself up. You feel less slightly insulted and more extremely insulted.<br /><br />"I'll take another," he says.<br /><br />"Me too," says the bartender, leaving you feeling slightly less hurt at having just been showered in your own creation.<br /><br />This is your chance to really show them what you can do. The taste of this "Sleepycat" is subtly different from the Silver Star you've made so many of because of slight differences between brands that the DeLune's bar stocks vs. the Argentum, but now that you've had a taste yourself, you're certain you know how to compensate for it. Alternatively, since the Sleepycat is a new drink, you could break from tradition a bit and bring the Sleepycat truly into its own.<br /><br />Not that your prospective boss will be able to tell the difference while he's busy being hyptonized by your movements. The bartender, on the other hand, seems to know his job.

This isn't the Silver Star. You can perfect that later. This is the Sleepycat, and it deserves to stand on its own. You make some slight tweaks. Give it a more relaxing flavor, but with that same sense of mischeif as a cat knocking a bottle of expensive wine off the counter. You consider altering the appearance, but decide that looking exactly like a different drink contributes to the sense of mischeif.<br /><br />You pass out another pair of glasses and keep the 3rd to yourself. The flavor and texture of the new Sleepycat is almost exactly what you were aiming for. Steve glances at you when he takes a sip. He's noticed the changes you made. The club owner, however, never tasted the Silver Star before he covered you and the bar in it, and simply comments on the drink itself.<br /><br />"Like I said today, I don't exactly have a job opening, but I can make one for you," the club owner says. "You know your way around a bar well enough, I'd like to get you trained on the rest of the job. Can you stay until closing tonight? I'll clock your time starting right now if you do."
