Choose Our Adventure Series: Antetus Argentum, part 1<br /><br />It's been a long night at work, in fact, and the day is getting ready to start again when your last patrons leave the bar, and the room, once cluttered with the drone of a dozen discconnected conversations is filled only by the late-night news stream, and the hum of an ancient jukebox in the corner. The newscaster's voice cuts out as you turn the monitor off with the remote hidden beneath the bar counter.<br /><br />You pick a couple of coins out from a dish sitting next to the register and walk over to the ancient music device, drop the two equally ancient metallic circles into a coin slot on the front, and select a couple of songs. Something to listen to, while you grab a cleaning rag and a spray bottle and begin making your final rounds on the bar, and clean the tables up for the night. Bottles are thrown in a large, blue recycling bin in the corner, glasses are placed in the sink and filled with water, dilluting the suds and drips of alcohol resting in the bottom, and every table is given a once-over with the rag, leaving it cleaned and ready for the start of tomorrow's business.

Choose Our Adventure Series: Antetus Argentum, #2<br /><br />Smooth jazz plays over the bar's speakers as you clear tables. Some patrons have left behind payment slips, single-use reciept printouts featuring the familiar machine-readable patterns which uniquely identify the bar's payment accounts. You scan each pattern, and the register beeps as it closes the orders from across the room, then you throw the payment strips into the trash, along with half-sodden coasters, peanut wrappers, and the occasional rare paper napkin.<br /><br />As you are tossing one fistfull of payment slips into the trash bin, something on the back of one of them catches your eye. A web handle that you thought you had kept separate from your daily life. One you have barely used even online. You fish the paper with the strangely familiar name on it out of the bin, and flatten it out to see the rest. Not much. Just your handle and twelve seemingly random words.

Choose Our Adventure Series: Antetus Argentum, #3<br /><br />You franticly think over your recent interactions both on the net and in the physical world, but you can't think of anything that would lead someone here. You crumple the paper and shove it into a pocket in your uniform. A haze of panicked distraction clouds your thoughts as you rush through stacking the stools and chairs on top of the bar tables. You sweep the floors, but forget to mop before turning the lights out, locking the door, and leaving.<br /><br />The sun is just peeking over the horizon. The Argentum bar, where you work, is located far from the city center. The buildings are older here, the roads still brick and cobblestone, but the dawn casts an intense backlight over the skyscrapers to the east, washing out the lights of people who are just going to bed , people who are just waking up, people who, like you, have worked through the night.

You rush quickly back to your apartment, the mystery slip of paper forgotten. You've never had Netflix, of course. Why pay to watch things when they don't even have what you want to watch half the time? Besides which, Stranger Things hasn't been available on Netflix for decades since being accquired by Disney. Your torrent should have finished while you were at work, though.<br /><br />Your door has an older-style mechanical lock on it. They still work when the power goes out, and don't have a network connection to hack, a problem that has come up for several of your neighbors recently. Your apartment is cozy and well-kept. You live alone, and so don't bother with shyness as you shed your bartender's vest, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt, tossing them into a pile. You also undo your long, silvery hair from the neat ponytail and let it hang loose across your shoulders. You throw on a comfy nightgown and grab a snack, and start the early morning TV binge that will kick off your mid-week weekend.<br /><br />What will you be eating during your marathon?

A knock at your front door clears any remnants of sleep. You check that you're at least presentable, and check the peep hole. The man on the other side has a neat brown haircut, brown eyes, is wearing a blue button-down shirt, and gray slacks. He's holding something with both hands, which looks like a dish of some sort. Next to him is a woman, bearing similarly nondescript features, and wearing a white button-down blouse. Their faces bear blank expressions.<br /><br />The man raps on the door again, and you open it. Their faces are both now bearing too-wide smiles. "Hello, Neighbor! We're the Smith family. My name is John, and this is my lovely wife, Jane. Just here to bring you a housewarming present, miss..."<br /><br />"Somna," you offer. His voice has the cadence of some sort of game show announcer. You can see, now, that the dish is a tray of brownies. "Isn't it a bit late in the day for greetings?"<br /><br />"We knocked on your door earlier," Jane's voice has the same overinflated cadence as her husband's. "You must have been asleep. Do you work nights?"<br /><br />John is holding the tray of brownies out to you.

"You take the plate of brownies. "Uh... yeah,"<br /><br />"Well, see you around," Jane says in her too-friendly way. The couple wave at you, and then walk back next door. You close and lock the door, and through the window you see that their animated facade and practically march past your window.<br /><br />Well that was weird. You set the brownies down on your kitchen counter and start gathering up the clothing that you have left strewn around the apartment. The weekend will end soon, and it would be nice to have a uniform to wear for work when it does. The vest pocket of your bartending uniform crumples asyou pick it up, and you remember the slip from last night.<br /><br />Who could that be from? What could they want?<br /><br />It would be so easy to just "accidentally" wash it with the rest of your laundry. That would destroy the note, but what of the person who wrote it?
