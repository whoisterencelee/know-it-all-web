For the Test Group card, let's change "Can't find any test groups" to "I can't find anyone!"

Instead of showing a desktop in the middle, let's just show the laptop screen and have the multiple phones under the screen, so we can just combine these two scenes into one.  Also in the multiple phones, maybe showing posting after posting of the same question, so questions marks after questions marks scrolling up.

Let's remove the sofa scene all together, just keep them standing the whole time, let's simplify and no more sitting and standing and snoozing.

Let's avoid moving the people between these two scenes, and also let's keep the dark green triangle in the background and avoid too much movement overall.  Can we still accommodate the logo, perhaps by reducing the size, actually is it possible to increase the resolution of the logo some more, there is still aliasing and blur on the edges of the logo.

The banner for ADD MONETARY INcENTIVE can have same green as the dollar bill (with white color word perhaps) and banner should also be big enough to cover the TO YOUR QUESITION . I am not sure if this looks good or not as I can't imagine the color conflict.

The "Add monetary incentive" scene is really too short, let's add this to the script:

"Know-it-All let's you add monetary incentive to you question."

"Now there is incentive for others to spend the time and effort to provide answers to your question! 
Quicker and better quality answers, all without any ads."

Can we switch the mobile phone from one side to another between different actions, phone on the right side for question creation, on left side for submit an answer and share link, on right again for invitation to answer.  With different phones sliding in and out on their respective sides.

While clicking share link, a bubble appears in the phone showing "Share this link with someone else to answer and earn reward"

Instead of New Question, should be "You've been invited to answer this question:"...

Let's do this part using the crowd scene, so the winner starts celebrating with the trophy in the crowd, then in the crowd the winning voters gets money as well, and the rest of the people fades out or claps?  So we don't need the sofa scenes.

Let's change the ending scene to two people shaking hands like the two people inside the bubble in the second screenshot.  And add the flying answer to the questioner and money in the breast pocket of the winning answerer.  The Download and Know-it-All logo stays.
