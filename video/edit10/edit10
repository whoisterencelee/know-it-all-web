I liked to change the text "New Question: ..." to "New Question @101: ..."

Click the submit answer link before the answer dialog appears. In another word, the finger clicks the "submit answer" link first, then the dark blue message pops up (can you make the text "Because you can thank someone who spent the time ..." appear one character or word at a time, like someone is typing)?

Can we add "@101 " in front of "Because you can thank someone ..."

This "Share this link with someone else to answer and earn reward" dialog should appear in the previous mobile phone (the left side one), make the "Because you can thank someone who spent the time to answer your question" dialog bubble mentioned above fade out and then subsitute it with "Share this link with someone ..."

In another word, this "Share this link with someone else ..." dialog is sent by the mobile which received the first broadcast.

Also similar to above, the finger clicks "or share link before the dialog box "Share this link with someone "... appears

In this scene, the white dialog box "New Question: ..." should be "You're been invited to answer question @101: ..." 

Can we have a different colour mobile phone too?

Add "@101 " in front of "Thanks for the invitation ..."
