For marketer, the first version is fine, because in the second version it's comparing two graphics and know-it-all can't compare graphics anyways.  How about removing the pin board and just have a few empty chairs like focus_group_chairs.png to indicate no test subjects?

Since they are sitting anyways, maybe have the men and woman's drop their heads back on the top of sofa and then dozing off.  The spider web no need anymore.

Let's transit into the green background earlier when the men and women is midway standing up.

So the left-right transition wont be need anymore. The green background indicates we're starting to describe a solution.

Let's show the logo first, before the user taking out the money.  Can we have the users smiling or an Eureka look when the logo shows up, maybe a light bulb moment.  So the sequence is logo, Eureka look, then "Add monetary incentive to your question" at the same time the user give takes out money. Can we slow this scene a little bit as this should be the main selling point.  How about after the users give money the answers (perhaps more than one) flies out of the logo.

Please add a "New Question" bubble (4th from the left on the second screenshot) that's missing from the first screenshot.  

Can we have the "New Question" bubbles shake a few times when they appear to indicate it's a notification.

When the phone enters, it vibrates / ring once before the "New Question:..." bubble appears, again to indicate it's a notification.  Also, let's use a different color for the phone bezel, so we know it's now other users with a different phone.

"Share link" bubbles dont need to shake, it's not a notification.  Let's wait for all share link bubbles to disappear before more people shows up.

Once the Share link bubbles disappears, then more people show up with the Invitation bubbles appears and shaking like a notification.  Again the phone vibrates / ring before the invitation. And again the phone bezel color is different again.

Let's show a big bag of money here on the right.

Instead of bag of money, the man in the speech bubble is holding a champion trophy.

Let's show some flying answers beside the two users on the bottom.  Let's have the two groups switched, the top group sharing money goes beside Obyte Logo, and the bottom group with flying answers switched to the top beside Know-it-All.
