The marketer maybe should be holding up a card with a simple Venn Diagram of Test Group A, B, C.  On the board maybe just have a simple "ADs Here" wording.

On the computer searching question online, just have the Ads poping up and blocking the search result in the screen instead of speech bubble.

Combine these two scenes, start with the frustrated looks in 3), then add the logo and monetization idea in the middle, then have the users hold a dollar bill, and then have multiple answers come and fly in like if the users were feeding pigeons, maybe they only have one hand up instead of two and move them more to the sides

Remove dedicated scene for "How it works" statement, combine it with the next few scenes by adding a Logo "How it works" as a title at the top

Showing the stopwatch is good, change percentage to 50% , the percentage and stopwatch should point to a question instead of answers, maybe show 3 answers underneath a question bubble with a different color

Combine these two scenes, but do want to emphrasize the Thank You some more, which is actually more gratifying then the money
