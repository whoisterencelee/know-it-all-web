Let's have the dark blue background trangle roll up with the computers in the first screenshot.  
For the second screenshot, let's flip the light green triangle vertically so it's a pyramid and "Let the answer find you!" roll up from the bottom.

The logo roll up from the bottom as well instead of explosion, and rest lower in the scene so the answers have more space to fly out of.
I noticed the wings on the right answer is same color as the background, let's change it so it's different from background.

The Banner Add monetary incentive to your question using the dollar green looks better I think.

Let's rid of the HOW IT WORKS banner, Originally we added it because there was too much space on the top.  But now that we have lot of movements maybe it's ok to have more space at the top.

The phones rolling in left and right is ok, the reason there is too much movement is because the submit answer (first screenshot) and share link (second screenshot) should be on the same phone and no need to switch sides between these two, just change the bottom bubble in the phone between the two.

Also the bottom bubble for "Share this link with someone..." should also be dark blue.

Let's add a bubble at the bottom of the phone "Thanks for the invitation, participating in this bot is awesome."

Let's bring back the crowd in the second screenshot and single out the winning men by having him jumping up and down within the crowd with trophy and the "Your answer was selected as the best" directed at the winner.  Then the winner voters also gets singled out from the crowd and the rest of the crowd fades out.  Then the money sharing is done without moving the people.

I liked the crowd scene quite a lot, it really shows the whole thing happens as a community.

Then have all the winners group together and the questioner shows up (with flying answer) shaking the answerer's hand, and a bag of money beside the winning group.
