I was wrong, "Ads Here" doesn't seems to get the point across, how about a big "Can't find any opinions" in Red, and instead of the Venn Diagram, "Can't find any test groups".

The 4 scenes are switching in and out too much, let's try to combine all.  The woman and man are each standing on the left and right side respectively, and everything happens in the middle, like this:

Let's combine these 2 scenes, remove the two people sitting scene. How about starting the crowd with just the few people (say half)  who received the broadcast and make everyone else invisible (not greyed out), then they share the link and more people appears.
